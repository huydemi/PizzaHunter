Fetching data over the network is one of the most common tasks in mobile apps.
You must write and manage a lot repetitive code such as:

- Managing duplicate requests.
- Canceling requests that are no longer needed, such as when user exits a screen.
- Fetching and processing data on background thread, and updating the UI on the main thread.
- Parsing responses and converting them into model objects.
- Showing and hiding loading indicators.
- Displaying data when it arrives.


[Siesta](https://github.com/bustoutsolutions/siesta) is a networking library that automates this work and reduces the complexity of your code involved in fetching and displaying data from the network.

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll build Pizza Hunter, an app that lets users search for pizza restaurants around them
